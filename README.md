## Soliloquy...

I finally decided to directly create a github repo as my blog site DESPERATELY after having explored or tried some blog-site solutions:
- The primary requirement is FREE, then is NO Advertisement. So I don't take any Chinese blog platforms into consideration. I eventually chose to deploy on Github-Pages as a compromise among convenience, network latency and sociality.
- I started up from building my self-designed frontend from scratch using Vue.js and ElementPlus. To achieve that, I crash the courses of frontend, I managed to solve the UI-layout, color and theme, router and page management. I was satisfied with all what I've done but blocked up when dealing with markdown-html rendering especially code highlight and katex support because of the poor docs of marked.js and highlight.js and so on...
- Then I tried solutions of site-generator hugo and hexo. I really took fancy of [Blowfish](https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish) whereas its CLI didn't work fine in Win and I couldn't bear struggling with those CONFIGs in the manually-xxx parts so the soon tried Fluid was also not a favor.

The whole procedure took me about a month in bits and pieces so I thought I'd better stop tossing over and focus on the content rather than form. Then this repo came out!
